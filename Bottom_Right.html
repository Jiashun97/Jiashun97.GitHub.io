<h2>About Me</h2>
<hr width = 900px align = "left"/> 
<p> <font size = "3.5">I am a fast-track PhD student in computational neuroscience at GSN-LMU 
  and I am currently in the preparatory year prior to my PhD phase.</p>
<p> <font size = "3.5"> Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in psychology at the 
  University of Amsterdam after my transferring from Beijing Normal University. 
  During my undergraduate period, I completed a research project where I was trying to decode visual 
  experience from EEG data using MVPA and comparing the performance of two preprocessing methods 
  (high-pass filtering and detrending). In another internship, I investigated the Bayesian model comparison 
  method and showed the intransitivity in the Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOO-CV) method.</p>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<hr width = 900px align = "left"/> 
<p> <font size = "3.5">I joined the <a href="https://www.ewi-psy.fu-berlin.de/en/einrichtungen/arbeitsbereiche/neural_dyn_of_vis_cog/index.html">
  Neural Dynamics of Visual Cognition Lab</a> in September 2020 as a research intern to work on a collaborative 
  project with Prof. Radoslaw Martin Cichy and Prof. Gemma Roig. My research interest lies in how machine 
  learning can help understand visual processing. Specifically, I am comparing the performance of different 
  machine learning models in predicting brain data (e.g. EEG, MEG, and fMRI). </font></p>



<h2>Skills</h2>
<hr width = 900px align = "left"/> 
<p> <font size = "3.5"> Python(good), R(good), MATLAB(familiar). </font></p>


<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<hr width = 900px align = "left"/> 
<p> <font size = "3.5"> In my free time, I am obsessed with road cycling. I also like weight training, bouldering and running.</font></p>
