<h2>About Me</h2>
<hr width = 900px align = "left"/> 
<p> <font size = "3.5">I am a fast-track PhD student in computational neuroscience at GSN-LMU 
  and I am currently employed by the Department of Psychology at LMU Munich. Before that, I obtained 
  my bachelor's degree with Honours in psychology at the University of Amsterdam after transferring 
  from Beijing Normal University. </p>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<hr width = 900px align = "left"/> 
<p> <font size = "3.5">My current research interests lie in using computational
   models (i.e. Drift-Diffusion Models, DDM) to study human decision making under urgency. I am also working on a brain imaging project in which I am trying
  to build a joint model of EEG and DDM to investigate change of mind in decision making. Furthermore, I have a general interest in applying DDM 
  to practical problems, such as in clinical settings and in the field of learning science. Feel free to drop me an email if you would like to
  collaborate. </font></p>



<h2>Skills</h2>
<hr width = 900px align = "left"/> 
<p> <font size = "3.5"> Python(good), R(good), MATLAB(familiar). </font></p>


<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<hr width = 900px align = "left"/> 
<p> <font size = "3.5"> Beside doing research, I am a serious road cyclist and a enthusiastic billiard player. 
  I also train for powerlifting and skiing during the long winter.</font></p>
